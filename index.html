			<h2>Types of AI</h2>
			<h3>1. Narrow AI</h3>
			<p>Narrow AI, also known as weak AI, is designed to perform specific tasks within a limited domain. Examples include virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, chatbots, and recommendation systems.</p>
			
			<h3>2. General AI</h3>
			<p>General AI, also referred to as strong AI, aims to possess the same level of intelligence as humans. It can understand, learn, and apply knowledge across various domains. General AI remains a goal for future development.</p>
			
			<h3>3. Machine Learning</h3>
			<p>Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data without explicit programming. Algorithms can analyze large datasets to make predictions or take actions without being explicitly programmed.</p>
			
			<h3>4. Neural Networks</h3>
			<p>Neural Networks are a type of AI that mimics the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected artificial neurons that process and transmit information. Neural networks are often used in image recognition, natural language processing, and pattern recognition tasks.</p>
